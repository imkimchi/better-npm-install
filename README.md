## Install

`npm i -g better-npm-install`


## Usage

```
$ ni <folder>
```

run `ni` without any arguments, when you are running in the project folder.


## Why

- Install missing dependencies from package.json
- Show deprecated dependencies
- No more unuseful log
- A way better interface

## How it works
**ni** will get imported dependencies from javascript codes in the project and figure out what is missing from `package.json` and install them.

I came up with this idea because I get really fraustrated when other developers don't save dependencies to `package.json` when they install dependency so I have to install them manually checking all the codes in the project. I hope it can be useful for y'all ðŸ’˜
