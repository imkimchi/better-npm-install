## Install

`npm i -g better-npm-install`


## Usage

```
$ ni <folder>
```

Run `ni` without any arguments, when you are running in the project folder.


## Why

- Install missing dependencies from package.json that npm won't install them for you
- Show deprecated dependencies
- No more unuseful log
- A way better interface
